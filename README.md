## About Project

Well, this project is about REST API. It was created an application that only serves the data in the Json format, and this would be an event management application.
You are able to browse through all the events. Also, you are able to post events, but not before we sign in.
So not only you create robust REST API, and then how to test them manually with Postman will also do some interesting stuff like sending notifications through emails, so we can send emails inside this project.
Then you can also learn about work with scheduling, background processing using queues and rate limiting.
